# Artemis-IL

A free and open source register-based virtual machine and intermediate language targeting .NET Standard.

Artemis-IL (AIL) provides a stable, portable compilation target with a small orthogonal instruction set, a two-pass assembler, a decompiler, and an integrated IDE (AIL Studio). The same AIL bytecode runs identically on any compliant VM implementation.

For the full language and VM specification, standard library reference, and instruction set, see the **[GitHub Wiki](../../wiki)**.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/source/Artemis-VM` | Core VM library (netstandard2.0) — registers, RAM, instruction execution |
| `/source/AIL-Runtime` | Command-line runtime host (net8.0) |
| `/source/AIL-Studio` | WinForms IDE with assembler, decompiler, and step debugger (net8.0-windows) |
| `/source/AIL-Tests` | xUnit test suite |
| `/wiki` | Mirror of the GitHub Wiki pages |
| `/docs` | Original reference documents |
| `/examples` | Sample `.ail` assembly programs |

## Building

Requires the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```sh
# Build all projects
dotnet build "Artemis IL.sln"

# Run the tests
dotnet test source/AIL-Tests/AIL-Tests.csproj
```

> **Note:** AIL-Studio targets `net8.0-windows` and will only build on Windows. The VM library, runtime, and tests build cross-platform.

---

## Running

```sh
# Run the built-in "Hello, World!" demo
dotnet run --project source/AIL-Runtime

# Run an AIL assembly file (compile first with AIL Studio, or pass raw bytecode)
dotnet run --project source/AIL-Runtime -- path/to/program.ila
```

---

## Examples

The `/examples` folder contains ready-to-assemble `.ail` programs:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hello_world_db.ail` | Prints "Hello, World" using the `DB` pseudo-instruction and the write-string interrupt |
| `calculator.ail` | Demonstrates arithmetic instructions and integer output |

Open any `.ail` file in AIL Studio to assemble, run, and step-debug it interactively.
